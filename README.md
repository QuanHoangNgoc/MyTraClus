# üõ∞Ô∏è **Trajectory Data Clustering and Visualization Project**

## üåü What is it?

This repository is a comprehensive project for **trajectory data analysis** that includes:
- **Trajectory Clustering** using advanced partitioning algorithms and clustering techniques like DBSCAN.
- **Visualization of Trajectories** to provide clear insights into how trajectory points are distributed and grouped.
- **Representative Trajectories** generation, summarizing clusters of trajectories for easy interpretation.

## üéØ Why did we do it?

With the rise of applications such as autonomous vehicles, urban traffic analysis, and movement pattern recognition, there is a growing need to efficiently process, analyze, and visualize large sets of trajectory data. This project aims to:
- **Cluster and Simplify Large Trajectories**: Reduce complex data into more manageable representative trajectories.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Perform data partitioning and clustering, even with millions of trajectory points.
- **Generate Insights**: Help researchers and developers visualize and interpret the movement data through representative trajectories.

## üë• Who is this for?

This project is designed for:
- **Data Scientists and Engineers** who work with trajectory data, spatio-temporal data, or related applications.
- **Researchers** interested in movement clustering and data simplification techniques.
- **Developers** looking for tools to analyze or visualize trajectories, whether from GPS, traffic analysis, or similar datasets.

### üñ•Ô∏è Demo and Results

1. **Trajectory Visualization**: Displays random subsets of trajectories to visualize their distribution.
2. **Data Partitioning**: Breaks down trajectories into meaningful segments using partitioning algorithms.
3. **Clustering with DBSCAN**: Groups trajectory segments into clusters based on similarity and distance.
4. **Representative Trajectories**: Extracts a single trajectory that represents the average path of each cluster.
5. **Trajectory Smoothing**: Smoothens trajectories for better visual representation and more accurate analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How did we do it?

### 1. **Cloning the Data**:
   - Trajectory data is cloned from a GitHub repository.
   - Data is cleaned, ensuring minimum points per trajectory, and loaded for further processing.

### 2. **Visualizing Raw Data**:
   - Random trajectories are visualized using `matplotlib` for inspection.
   - Histograms of the trajectory lengths are generated for a high-level overview of the dataset.

### 3. **Partitioning Algorithms**:
   - Trajectories are divided into characteristic points using custom geometric algorithms that minimize distance and angle errors between segments.
   - This results in a simplified version of each trajectory, making further processing more efficient.

### 4. **Clustering with DBSCAN**:
   - DBSCAN is applied to the feature vectors derived from trajectory segments. It groups similar trajectories while identifying outliers.
   - Each segment is transformed into feature vectors based on distance, direction, and trajectory length.

### 5. **Generating Representative Trajectories**:
   - For each cluster, a **representative trajectory** is generated by computing the average path.
   - Visualized alongside original segments to show how well the representative trajectory approximates the actual data.

### 6. **Smoothing Trajectories**:
   - Representative trajectories are smoothened using a moving average to reduce noise and make them more interpretable.

## üìò What did we learn?

- **Handling Large Trajectory Datasets**: How to efficiently partition, cluster, and summarize large sets of trajectory data.
- **Geometric Algorithms**: We developed custom algorithms for trajectory partitioning based on distances and angles, allowing us to reduce data complexity while maintaining accuracy.
- **Clustering Techniques**: How DBSCAN, combined with KD-trees and feature vector extraction, can be used to cluster trajectory data effectively.
- **Visualization**: Visualization is key to understanding and interpreting trajectory data; we learned the importance of clear, informative graphs.

## üèÜ Achievements

- **Efficient Clustering of Trajectories**: Successfully clustered and represented thousands of trajectories with minimal computational overhead.
- **Simplified Data Representation**: Developed an efficient method for summarizing complex movement patterns into manageable representations.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Generated insightful visualizations that help users understand the structure and distribution of trajectory data.
